## 1. **Update Current Packages**

	Before you begin, ensure your system is fully updated.

	
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt upgrade
	sudo apt dist-upgrade
	

	The `dist-upgrade` command handles any dependency changes, including removing obsolete packages.

## 2. **Remove Old Packages**

	You can remove unnecessary packages to avoid any potential conflicts during the upgrade.

	
	sudo apt autoremove
	

## 3. **Install Update Manager (if not already installed)**

	Ensure that the `update-manager-core` package is installed:


	sudo apt install update-manager-core


## 4. **Start the Upgrade Process**

	Run the following command to start the upgrade process:

	
	sudo do-release-upgrade
	

	- If you want to upgrade to a **development version** (like Ubuntu 24.04 before itâ€™s officially stable), you can use:

	  
	  sudo do-release-upgrade -d
	  

	This will trigger the upgrade process. The system may prompt you with some questions during the upgrade (such as to keep or replace certain configuration files). 

## 5. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions**

	Follow the instructions on the screen. The upgrade may take some time depending on your internet speed and system configuration. Once the upgrade is complete, the system will prompt you to reboot.

## 6. **Reboot the System**

	After the upgrade is complete, reboot your system:

	sudo reboot
	

## 7. **Verify the Upgrade**

	Once your system has rebooted, you can verify that you're running the correct version by running:

	
	lsb_release -a
	

	This will show the details of the new version of Ubuntu.

## Important Notes:

	- **Backup your data**: It's highly recommended to back up all important data before upgrading.
	- **Ensure a stable internet connection**: Since the upgrade might download many packages, a stable and fast internet connection is recommended.
	- **Test on a Virtual Machine (VM)**: If you're unsure about upgrading on a production machine, consider testing the upgrade in a VM or on a separate partition first.
