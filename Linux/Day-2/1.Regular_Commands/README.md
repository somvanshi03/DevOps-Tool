# File and Dir Management commands
	
	Here are the most commonly used file and directory management commands in Linux, along with examples for each:

## 1. `ls` - List files and directories

	The `ls` command lists the files and directories in a specified location.

	- **Basic usage:**
	
	ls
	
	This will list the files and directories in the current directory.

	- List files with details (permissions, size, date, etc.):
	
	ls -l
	

	- List all files, including hidden ones:

	ls -a
	

	- List with human-readable file sizes:
	
	ls -lh
	

## 2. `touch` - Create an empty file or update the timestamp

	The `touch` command is used to create a new empty file or to update the modification and access timestamps of an existing file.

	- Create an empty file:
	
	touch file_name.txt
	

	- Update timestamp of an existing file:

	touch existing_file.txt
	

## 3. `vi` - Edit a file using the vi editor

	The `vi` command opens a file in the `vi` (or `vim`) text editor.

	- Open a file for editing:
	
	vi file_name.txt
	
	Once inside `vi`, you can:
	  - Press `i` to enter insert mode (to start editing).
	  - Press `Esc` to exit insert mode.
	  - Type `:w` to save changes.
	  - Type `:q` to quit `vi`.
	  - Type `:wq` to save and quit at the same time.

## 4. `cp` - Copy files or directories

	The `cp` command is used to copy files or directories.

	- Copy a file:
	
	cp source_file.txt destination_file.txt
	

	- Copy a file to another directory:
	
	cp file.txt /path/to/destination/
	

	- Copy a directory (with the `-r` option for recursive):
	
	cp -r source_directory/ destination_directory/
	

## 5. `mv` - Move or rename files and directories

	The `mv` command is used to move files or directories, and also to rename them.

	- Rename a file:
	
	mv old_name.txt new_name.txt
	

	- Move a file to another directory:
	
	mv file.txt /path/to/destination/
	

	- Move a directory:
	
	mv source_directory/ /path/to/destination/
	

## 6. **`rm` - Remove files

	The `rm` command is used to delete files.

	- Delete a file:
	
	rm file_name.txt
	

	- Delete multiple files:
	
	rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
	

	- Force remove a file (without asking for confirmation):
	
	rm -f file_name.txt
	

	- Delete a non-empty directory (use `-r` to remove recursively):
	
	rm -r directory_name/
	

## 7. **`rmdir` - Remove empty directories

	The `rmdir` command is used to delete empty directories.

	- Remove an empty directory:
	
	rmdir directory_name
	

	- Attempt to remove a non-empty directory (will fail if directory isn't empty):
	
	rmdir non_empty_directory
	

## 8. `mkdir` - Create directories

	The `mkdir` command is used to create directories.

	- Create a single directory:
	
	mkdir directory_name
	

	- Create multiple directories:
	
	mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3
	

	- Create parent directories if they don't exist (`-p` option):
	
	mkdir -p parent_dir/child_dir/grandchild_dir
