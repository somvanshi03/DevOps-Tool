Sure, here's a bash script that checks all mounted filesystems on a Linux system and sends an email if any partition usage exceeds 90%. The script uses df to check disk space and mail to send the email. Make sure you have mail installed and configured to send emails from your server.

bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
EMAIL="your_email@example.com" # replace with your email address
SUBJECT="Disk Space Alert for $(hostname)"
BODY_FILE="/tmp/disk_space_alert.txt"
THRESHOLD=90

# Check each mounted filesystem
while read -r filesystem size used available percent mountpoint
do
  # Skip the header line
  if [ "$filesystem" == "Filesystem" ]; then
    continue
  fi

  # Remove the percentage sign from usage
  percent=${percent%?}

  # Check if usage exceeds the threshold
  if [ "$percent" -ge "$THRESHOLD" ]; then
    # Write to the body file
    echo "Warning: $mountpoint is ${percent}% full." >> "$BODY_FILE"
  fi
done < <(df -h --output=source,size,used,avail,pcent,target)

# Check if the body file has content, then send an email
if [ -s "$BODY_FILE" ]; then
  mail -s "$SUBJECT" "$EMAIL" < "$BODY_FILE"
  echo "Disk space alert sent to $EMAIL."
else
  echo "No filesystems exceeding $THRESHOLD% threshold."
fi

# Clean up the temporary body file
rm "$BODY_FILE"


Before running the script, make sure to:
- Replace your_email@example.com with the actual email address where you want to receive the alert.
- Set the THRESHOLD variable to the percentage of disk usage that should trigger an alert.

To execute this script:
1. Save the script to a file, for example, disk_space_alert.sh.
2. Give it execute permissions with the command: chmod +x disk_space_alert.sh.
3. Run the script: ./disk_space_alert.sh.

This script will send an email alert only if any partition's usage exceeds the specified threshold. If you need assistance with setting up mail or have any specific requirements for the alert, feel free to ask for further guidance.
