Minishift is a tool that helps you run OpenShift locally by launching a single-node OpenShift cluster inside a virtual machine. Here's a step-by-step guide to install Minishift on Ubuntu:

Step 1: Install KVM and Libvirt
Minishift requires a hypervisor to run the virtual machine. On Ubuntu, KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) along with libvirt can be used.

Update the package index:


sudo apt update
Install KVM, libvirt, and other required packages:


sudo apt install -y qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils
Add your user to the libvirt and kvm groups:


sudo usermod -aG libvirt $(whoami)
sudo usermod -aG kvm $(whoami)
Start and enable the libvirtd service:


sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd
Verify the installation:


virsh list --all
Step 2: Install Minishift
Download the latest Minishift release:


wget https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases/download/v1.34.3/minishift-1.34.3-linux-amd64.tgz
Extract the tarball:


tar -xvf minishift-1.34.3-linux-amd64.tgz
Move the minishift binary to a directory in your PATH:


sudo mv minishift-1.34.3-linux-amd64/minishift /usr/local/bin/
Verify the installation:


minishift version
Step 3: Start Minishift
Set the KVM driver:


minishift config set vm-driver kvm
Start Minishift:


minishift start
Wait for Minishift to download the necessary files and start the OpenShift cluster. This might take some time.

Step 4: Access OpenShift
Once Minishift has started, you can access the OpenShift web console:


minishift console
This command will open the OpenShift web console in your default web browser.

You can log in with the default username and password:

Username: developer
Password: developer
Step 5: Using OpenShift CLI (oc)
To interact with your OpenShift cluster using the oc CLI tool, you need to add the oc binary to your PATH. Minishift provides an easy way to do this:


eval $(minishift oc-env)
You can now use the oc command to interact with your OpenShift cluster:


oc login -u developer -p developer
Step 6: Stop and Delete Minishift
To stop the Minishift VM:


minishift stop
To delete the Minishift VM:


minishift delete
Summary
This guide walks you through installing and setting up Minishift on Ubuntu, which includes installing the necessary dependencies, downloading and setting up Minishift, starting the OpenShift cluster, and accessing the OpenShift web console and CLI. With Minishift, you can easily create a local OpenShift environment for development and testing purposes.
