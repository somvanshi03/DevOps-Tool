Here are some practical shell script project ideas that can help you hone your skills and be useful in real-world scenarios:

### 1. *Automated Backup Script*
Create a script to automate the process of backing up important files or directories to another location, such as an external drive or a remote server.

*Features:*
- Specify source and destination directories.
- Include date and time in the backup filename.
- Optionally compress the backup.
- Log backup activity.

*Example Script:*
sh
#!/bin/bash

SOURCE="/path/to/source"
DESTINATION="/path/to/destination"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S")
BACKUP_FILE="backup-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz"
LOGFILE="/path/to/backup.log"

echo "Starting backup at $(date)" >> $LOGFILE
tar -czf $DESTINATION/$BACKUP_FILE $SOURCE >> $LOGFILE 2>&1

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Backup successful: $BACKUP_FILE" >> $LOGFILE
else
  echo "Backup failed" >> $LOGFILE
fi

echo "Backup completed at $(date)" >> $LOGFILE


### 2. *System Monitoring Script*
Develop a script to monitor system resources such as CPU, memory usage, disk space, and network activity, and send alerts if certain thresholds are exceeded.

*Features:*
- Check CPU, memory, and disk usage.
- Send email alerts if usage exceeds a specified threshold.
- Log monitoring data.

*Example Script:*
sh
#!/bin/bash

THRESHOLD=80
LOGFILE="/path/to/monitor.log"
EMAIL="admin@example.com"

CPU_USAGE=$(top -b -n1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2 + $4}')
DISK_USAGE=$(df -h / | grep / | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//g')
MEMORY_USAGE=$(free | grep Mem | awk '{print $3/$2 * 100.0}')

echo "CPU: $CPU_USAGE%, Disk: $DISK_USAGE%, Memory: $MEMORY_USAGE%" >> $LOGFILE

if [ $(echo "$CPU_USAGE > $THRESHOLD" | bc) -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "CPU usage is above threshold" | mail -s "CPU Alert" $EMAIL
fi

if [ $DISK_USAGE -gt $THRESHOLD ]; then
  echo "Disk usage is above threshold" | mail -s "Disk Alert" $EMAIL
fi

if [ $(echo "$MEMORY_USAGE > $THRESHOLD" | bc) -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Memory usage is above threshold" | mail -s "Memory Alert" $EMAIL
fi


### 3. *Log File Analyzer*
Create a script to analyze log files for patterns, such as failed login attempts, errors, or other significant events.

*Features:*
- Parse log files for specific patterns.
- Generate a summary report.
- Send the report via email.

*Example Script:*
sh
#!/bin/bash

LOGFILE="/var/log/auth.log"
REPORT="/path/to/report.txt"
EMAIL="admin@example.com"

echo "Failed login attempts:" > $REPORT
grep "Failed password" $LOGFILE | awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $11, $13}' >> $REPORT

echo "Error entries:" >> $REPORT
grep "error" $LOGFILE >> $REPORT

mail -s "Log File Report" $EMAIL < $REPORT


### 4. *User Management Script*
Develop a script to automate user account management tasks such as adding, removing, or modifying user accounts on a Linux system.

*Features:*
- Add new users with default settings.
- Remove users and their home directories.
- Change user passwords.

*Example Script:*
sh
#!/bin/bash

ACTION=$1
USERNAME=$2
PASSWORD=$3

if [ "$ACTION" == "add" ]; then
  useradd -m $USERNAME
  echo $USERNAME:$PASSWORD | chpasswd
  echo "User $USERNAME added."
elif [ "$ACTION" == "remove" ]; then
  userdel -r $USERNAME
  echo "User $USERNAME removed."
elif [ "$ACTION" == "passwd" ]; then
  echo $USERNAME:$PASSWORD | chpasswd
  echo "Password for $USERNAME changed."
else
  echo "Usage: $0 {add|remove|passwd} username [password]"
fi


### 5. *Network Utility Script*
Create a script that performs various network-related tasks, such as checking connectivity, finding active IP addresses in the network, or monitoring network traffic.

*Features:*
- Ping a list of hosts.
- Scan the local network for active IP addresses.
- Monitor network traffic.

*Example Script:*
sh
#!/bin/bash

SUBNET="192.168.1"
LOGFILE="/path/to/network.log"

echo "Scanning network $SUBNET.0/24" > $LOGFILE

for IP in $(seq 1 254); do
  ping -c 1 -W 1 $SUBNET.$IP &> /dev/null
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Host $SUBNET.$IP is up" >> $LOGFILE
  fi
done

echo "Network scan complete." >> $LOGFILE


These projects should give you a good start in writing practical shell scripts for real-world scenarios. Customize and expand them as needed to fit your specific requirements.
